# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## 🧾 Program
t = tuple(input("Enter elements separated by space: ").split()) t = tuple(int(x) if x.isdigit() else x for x in t) print("'n' exists in tuple:", 'n' in t) print("8 exists in tuple:", 8 in t)

## Output
Enter elements separated by space: a n 5 8 x 'n' exists in tuple: True 8 exists in tuple: True
## Result
The program executed successfully and checked whether the elements 'n' and 8 exist in the given tuple using membership operators.
